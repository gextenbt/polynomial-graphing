# Graph polynomial
This code relates to polynomial functions graphing using Matplotlib library.

There are 2 types of "input":
- Simple. Just write your function (e.g. 2*x**2 + 2*x -5/2)
- Part. Firstly you write order, then coefficients for terms (from the highest to the lowest degree)

After input you can choose the limits of a graph
